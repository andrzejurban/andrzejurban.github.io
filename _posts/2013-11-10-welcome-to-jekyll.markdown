This is the first (and I hope not the last) post on my blog. The main reason for it's creation was the need to maintain my english skills on an acceptable level.
It's also here to help me organize the way I learn stuff.
I hope the thought of having potential readers (event imaginary ones) would make me dig into stuff a bit deeper and record the output more often.


 
You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
